# Reporting effort config macros README

This folder contains macros that **used by the config** programs e.g. by `verasetup.sas`

Macros that are intended to be used by prod, qc or shared between prod and qc should
be stored in one of the following:

- re_<reporting effort>\prod\util\macros
- re_<reporting effort>\qc\util\macros
- re_<reporting effort>\shared\macros
